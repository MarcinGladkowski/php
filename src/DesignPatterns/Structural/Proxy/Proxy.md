### When to Use the Proxy Pattern
Perfect Scenarios:    
- Lazy Loading: When you have expensive resources that shouldn’t be loaded until needed  
- Access Control: When you need to implement security or permission checks  
- Caching: When you want to cache expensive operations  
- Logging: When you need to log method calls without modifying the original class  
- Remote Access: When you need to represent a remote object locally
- Rate Limiting: When you need to control the frequency of operations

Anti-Patterns: When NOT to Use
- Simple Operations: Don’t use proxy for trivial operations where the overhead isn’t worth it
- When You Need to Modify Behavior: Use Decorator pattern instead
- When You Need to Change Interface: Use Adapter pattern instead
